Severe disruption after Ayr derailment
Rail services in Ayrshire and Glasgow are beginning to return to normal following a derailment at a depot.
There have been reduced services from Ayr to Glasgow Central while services between Glasgow Central and Ardrossan Harbour were suspended.Buses replaced trains between Ayr, Girvan, Stranraer and Kilmarnock.Work was carried out on Friday morning to get the derailed train back on the tracks so that other trains could get out of the Ayr depot.At the height of the disruption, a ScotRail spokesman said: "We are sorry but due to a train having been involved in a minor derailment within a depot late last night, we have a limited number of available trains this morning at Ayr as they are unable to depart the depot just now."Our staff are continuing to work hard to get the affected train back on the rails so that we can get other trains out of the depot."
