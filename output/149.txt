Scotland's papers: RBS 'olive branch'
The Royal Bank of Scotland has "finally listened" to its customers and called off the closure of 10 rural branches after announcing in December that 62 of its banks would close, writes the Daily Record.
The Scottish Daily Mail said the decision was welcomed by politicians, communities and union leaders but cautioned that it could be merely a "stay of execution" after the bank warned the branches would only remain open if business picked up.The Press and Journal, which had launched its Save Our Banks campaign, hails the decision to keep 10 branches open, but adds it is little comfort to those in the north-east of Scotland, where branch closures will go ahead as planned.Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland executives have been accused of misleading the Westminster Parliament over the lender's mistreatment of small businesses at the hands of its controversial restructuring unit, according to The Herald.
