Trump admin delays decision on $17B Boeing, Iran aircraft deal

Boeing has argued that making the details of the sale available in court and to the public would harm their posture in the marketplace and potentially undermine the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
The court has ordered the US government to state its position on the sale and its relevance -- or lack thereof -- to national security but Thursday's request to move the deadline is not consistent with the Trump administration's broader views regarding Iran and the nuclear deal, according to Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an attorney for the Leibovitch family.
"While we do not believe Boeing, a private non governmental company, had any right to assert a national security privilege in the first place it now seems pretty clear that the Trump Administration's position is that the Iran Deal is a dangerous threat to the United States and should be decertified," Darshan-Leitner told CNN.
"As such, we are hopeful that the court will allow the American terror victims in this case, who are owed millions of dollars in unsatisfied court judgments from the Islamic Republic, to receive the information Boeing has been desperately attempting to conceal - the details of its airplane deal with the terrorist regime in Tehran," she said.
Trump appears poised to "decertify" the Iran nuclear deal on Friday and is expected to lay out an aggressive new whole-of-government strategy to counter Iran's regional aggression and its threats worldwide.
But given the expectations around the Iran nuclear plan, the court ordered deadline "put the Trump administration in a corner," a former senior Israeli official who dealt with financial warfare against Iran told CNN ahead of the DOJ's request for an extension.
"The decision is now a political one," the official said, adding how the administration handled its role in the proceedings would be sign of whether Trump is just talking about going after Iran or if he means business.
