A mezzanine floor has collapsed at the Jakarta stock exchange building (IDX), injuring dozens of people.
Dramatic CCTV footage captured the moment of collapse, which sent a group of more than 30 students gathered on the mezzanine crashing into the lobby.The area was evacuated and cordoned off by police, but trading has now resumed.Police say 72 people were hurt and are being treated in three different hospitals in Jakarta, but there have been no fatalities.Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told local media that some of the victims, who had injuries to their hands and feet, had been taken to nearby hospitals.Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, JakartaPolice using dogs and riot gear have pushed journalists back from the lobby area where the roof collapsed. They say it was not a terrorist attack, but they are still investigating what caused the floor to collapse. Fifteen ambulances have left the scene carrying the injured, officers say.It happened during most people's lunch break so the building was quieter than usual, but there were still hundreds of people there.The Jakarta stock exchange is a grand two-tower building with a vast marble floor lobby.
