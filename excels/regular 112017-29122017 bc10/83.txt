ACLU opposes Trump admin on access to abortions for 2 undocumented teens

Trump admin asks Supreme Court to review immigrant abortion case
"We've already stopped the Trump administration from blocking one young woman's abortion," read a statement from Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. "But the Trump administration is relentless in its cruelty, blocking abortion access for the most marginalized people in our country. It's unreal that the federal government is trying to force more young women to continue their pregnancies against their will."
