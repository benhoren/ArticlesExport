Trump admin. preventing immigrant minor from getting abortion, ACLU says

The lawsuit names several government employees, including Eric Hargan, acting secretary of Health and Human Services, as defendants.
"Jane Doe is a brave and persistent young woman who has already been forced by the Trump administration to delay her abortion for weeks. The government is holding her hostage so that she will be forced to carry to term against her will," Amiri said.

In a statement, the Administration for Children & Families at HHS defended its care of the teenager and its decision.
"There is no constitutional right for a pregnant minor to illegally cross the US border and get an elective abortion while in federal custody," the statement said.
"Federal law is very clear on giving the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement the legal responsibility to care for the health and well-being of a minor in the unaccompanied alien children program and, in this case, her unborn baby," the statement said. "We cannot cede our responsibility to care for minors and their babies by releasing them to ideological advocacy groups."
The ACLU claims its client was required to visit a religiously affiliated "crisis pregnancy center" to undergo counseling to continue the pregnancy, and she was required to have a sonogram against her will.
Amiri said in a statement that the Trump administration's action is shocking and unconstitutional.
"And this case isn't the only one -- nationally, the federal government is obstructing young immigrant women's access to abortion. It's blatantly unconstitutional, not to mention unconscionable," Amiri said.
Texas law requires parental consent or a judicial waiver before an abortion. The lawsuit said the girl does not want her family to know she is pursuing an abortion.
