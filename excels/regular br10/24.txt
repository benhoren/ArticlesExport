WaPo: Trump admin looking to privatize International Space Station

A report on the tech website The Verge said a draft of the budget proposal anticipated ending funding for the space station after 2024, which the Post report followed up with news that the administration was looking to keep the ISS operational, but not on its dime or under its authority.
The station is a joint project of several space-faring nations, and NASA has contracted with private companies, like Boeing and SpaceX, to reach it in recent years. In 2014, the Obama administration supported funding for the station through 2024, and the potential transfer of the ISS to private hands would mark a significant step in the trend toward private companies engaging in space travel.
Initiatives included in administration budget proposals are not necessarily reflected in the appropriations authorized by Congress, and, as the Post noted, a plan to phase out the ISS would likely face pushback from lawmakers.
