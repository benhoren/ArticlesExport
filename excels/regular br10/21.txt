Teacher says school asked to be notified if Cruz arrived with backpack

What happened, moment by moment, in the Florida school massacre
In that interview, Gard was asked whether the school had been concerned about Cruz earlier and said that some of the students said the teen had been disciplined.
"Some of the girls in my class said that, I guess, he had some problems with other girls."
Gard said he remembered "an e-mail or two from admin" but couldn't remember the content in the messages.
"If I was on my laptop, I could probably go back and find it and know for sure. Of course, admin would know a whole lot better about that than I."
Gard said he shielded six students in his classroom from the shooter, who was about 50 feet away.
